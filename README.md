# GradebookCalculator
A basic and personal grade book with built in grade calculation.

This application is targeted towards students as there is no instructor variant, or option. 

## Requirements
The application is coded in Python 3 and should therefore run on any system after the installation of Python 3.

Windows: Install Python 3 from https://www.python.org/ or the Windows Store.

MAC OS: Newer versions have Python 3 by default. For older versions install Python 3 from https://www.python.org/

Linux: Some distros may use Python 3 by default or if they still use Python 2, the package manager of the distro should be able to install Python 3, without issue.

## Limitations
The application is limited to nine classes and ten categories or grade entries. This limits the number of classes and individual grades that can be tracked. At the time this was plenty for use by myself and my colleagues, but it can be an issue for some potential users.

The first limitation leads to a second, after ten grade entries if one has more than ten assignments to enter they must be averaged beforehand. This can be done by category, or an additional class block must be used to average the assignments.

Finally, the last and most significant limitation is the lack of a save feature. Therefore, the gradebook must be kept open or the user must reenter all of the information again. 

This was my first major project of mine and was done in a short time with a very basic understanding of computer science and programming. This is the reason for the limitations. I have thought about redesigning the interface, refactoring code, and remedying the limitations, but I think it is nice to have a record of one work. Using all the knowledge I have compiled over my education, and career to rework this project would take away from the before and after of my projects. This serves as a humble reminder of where I started.

Another item of note that ties into the above are the admittedly terrible coding conventions. Many of the comments and method/variable names are not done in line with any documentation or naming conventions.


That all being said, version 2.0 may be a future project. The application may also be entirely redone and the original left as is.
